            <p className="mb-4">
              This website is maintained by the <a href="#" className="text-inadvertent-yellow underline">Stop LAPD Spying Coalition</a>, a
              community group based in the Skid Row neighborhood of 
              downtown Los Angeles.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-4">
              Over a decade ago, Stop LAPD Spying developed a copwatch 
              practice that we call <strong>Watch the Watchers</strong>. Copwatch refers to the 
              practice of community members teaming up to observe and 
              document police abuses, especially arrests and other violence. 
              Watch the Watchers built on this practice with a focus on 
              surveillance methodologies and technologies. You can watch 
              videos explaining our Watch the Watchers work at May Day
              actions in MacArthur Park <a href="#" className="text-inadvertent-yellow underline">in 2015</a>, where we exposed LAPD
              undercover surveillance, and <a href="#" className="text-inadvertent-yellow underline">in 2017</a>, where LAPD officers tried to
              lie about spy technologies deployed to monitor the crowd.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              This website is intended as a tool to empower community 
              members engaged in copwatch and other countersurveillance 
              practices. You can use it to identify officers who are causing harm 
              in your community. The website's ease of use also makes it a 
              political statement, flipping the direction of surveillance against 
              the state's agents. Police have vast information about all of us at 
              their fingertips, yet they move in secrecy.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-inadvertent-yellow">WHERE IS THE DATA FROM?</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              All data on this website is drawn from public records released by 
              city agencies. You can read more about Stop LAPD Spying's work 
              with public records in a zine we published in 2022, <a href="#" className="text-inadvertent-yellow underline">Know Your
              Rights: Using Public Records Laws in Abolitionist Organizing</a>.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              The project first began after we obtained a full roster of all LAPD 
              personnel along with headshot photographs of every officer that 
              LAPD had released in response to a public records request. LAPD 
              regularly uses photos like this on its website and in propaganda 
              materials, but they denied the public records request claiming 
              that none of these photographs exist in a digitized format, so an 
              LAPD unit "whose primary responsibility is to provide evidentiary 
              photography" would need "to take affirmative steps to manually 
              locate the negatives and produce photos." LAPD claimed that this 
              would be "unduly burdensome."
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              That was a lie, and the Stop LAPD Spying Coalition provided legal 
              support to address the issue. We helped file a lawsuit against the 
              City of Los Angeles exposing that these photos were readily 
              available and a matter of public record. In response to the lawsuit, 
              LAPD turned over more than 9,000 headshot photographs. We 
              then filed additional Public Records Act requests and lawsuits to 
              both LAPD and the City Controller to obtain further details on 
              every officer.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-inadvertent-yellow">IS THIS DATA PRIVATE? DIDN'T THE CITY SUE YOU TO CENSOR IT?</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              All of the information on this website comes from records that 
              were deliberately made public by the City of Los Angeles in 
              response to either public records requests or public records 
              lawsuits. That means all of this information belongs to the public 
              and is a matter of public record. But within days of us launching 
              this website, police began a misinformation campaign to claim 
              that we were violating officers' privacy and putting them in 
              danger. Police are so accustomed to getting everything they want
              and to making themselves look like victims that politicians and the
              press lined up behind the false police narrative.
           </p>
           
           <p className="mb-4">
             The campaign to demonize and discredit us soon escalated to litigation. The Los Police Protective League, a policy lobby group, filed a lawsuit against the city and police chief demanding that they take legal action against us to shut down the website. In turn, City Attorney Hydee Feldstein Soto filed a lawsuit against us and the journalist who first obtained the photographs, demanding that we all censor these records from the internet. The court promptly rejected their request. The city eventually dismissed their lawsuit and agreed to pay $300,000 in attorney fees to the attorneys who defended us and the journalist.
           </p>
           
           <p className="mb-6">
             That was one of two lawsuits the city filed against us. The second lawsuit was a cross-complaint the city filed in a case initiated by over 9,000 anonymous individuals who claim that they are each secret police officers and that this website caused them both physical pain and emotional suffering. We have no idea who these people are, and we believe the case is a scam to defraud the public. The city's cross-claims against us sought to make us pay potentially millions of dollars in damages to those officers. We promptly filed to dismiss the claims against us, and the court granted our motion. The court held that the public has a First Amendment right to publish all of this information.
           </p>
           
           <p className="mb-6">
             Despite courts throwing out the city's frivolous lawsuits against us, the fight continues. Since early 2023, LAPD has largely stopped complying with requests for officer rosters and other information. We have been fighting that in at least seven lawsuits that we filed against the City of Los Angeles in 2023 and 2024. In addition, City Attorney Hydee Feldstein Soto has been lobbying for legislators to amend the public records act to make secret any "data that may personally identify" a police officer. This proposal would shroud all of California's police agencies in secrecy, blocking any requests for information that names or otherwise identifies an officer. It would turn every law enforcement agency in the state into a secret police force. So far we have succeeded in blocking this dangerous and repressive proposal, but the City Attorney is likely to keep trying, especially as she courts more donations from the City Attorney.
           </p>

           <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-inadvertent-yellow">HOW RELIABLE IS THE DATA?</h2>
           <p className="mb-4">
             Again, all the data used to build this website is drawn from city records, so we can only vouch for it up to that extent. The data is only accurate as of the date we received it from a city agency, and it's possible that either LAPD or an officer provided inaccurate or incomplete data. The bottom of each officer's profile page includes detailed disclaimers explaining when we received the information and how or why it might be inaccurate. For example, because police move frequently between divisions/bureau and some might have multiple division/bureau assignments, the our information is likely to out of date.
           </p>
           
           <p className="mb-6">
             We plan to keep refreshing this data from new public records requests as well as to add other data.
           </p>
           
           <p className="mb-6">
